## Self-Assessment

Completing the artifact required for my Computer Science Capstone has not only allowed me to practice the skills I have learned throughout my degree, but also given me more confidence by showing me that I can figure out the issues that popped up while writing this program. This artifact has allowed me to showcase my ability to write the code and fix an existing program. It has also allowed me to learn about databases and actually create a functioning database that work through a console in java. The computer science program at SNHU has allowed me to work with a team on a jukebox program where we could all add our favorite songs into a group shared jukebox. It has also let me work in a scrum team with my fellow students, this has allowed us each to assume a role and practice the teamwork environment that we will experience on the job in the future.  This project was completed directly after finishing a security course that reminded me that default cases should be to lock a person out and not grant them access. This allowed me to implement that into the security of this program to avoid unauthorized access. This also let me think about how the user should be able to set their own password, so the passwords are now default when a user is added to the system and then the user can change their own password.

This single artifact demonstrates my ability to design and engineer softare, to use datastructures and algorithms, and to use databases.

How I addressed each topic with this Employee Authentication System artifact:

- Software design and engineering
  * Fixed the original program to make it functional
  * Altered the program to make it more generalized for a business to use
  * Added the ability to change the users password

- Data structures and algorithms
  * Added a messaging system using linked lists
  * Searched through the users to make sure messages are sent to the correct person
  * Allows the user to delete their messages or send messages

- Databases
  * Added an Employee Information database
  * Allows an admin to add or remove the user from the system
  * Updates the messaging system to clear out the messages for removed users

## Code review

The code review for the orignal code is to large to upload directly. Because of this, I have uploded it to youtube and provided the link here:

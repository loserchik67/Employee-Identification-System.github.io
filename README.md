## Employee Authentication System

This portfolio showcases what I have learned throughout my bachelors degree program. It specifically demonstrates my software design and engineering abilities. It also demonstrates my ablities to use data structures and algorithms as well as databases.

## How I addressed each topic

- Software design and engineering
  * Fixed the original program to make it functional
  * Altered the program to make it more generalized for a business to use
  * Added the ability to change the users password

- Data structures and algorithms
  * Added a messaging system using linked lists
  * Searched through the users to make sure messages are sent to the correct person
  * Allows the user to delete their messages or send messages

- Databases
  * Added an Employee Information database
  * Allows an admin to add or remove the user from the system
  * Updates the messaging system to clear out the messages for removed users

## Code review

The code review for the orignal code is to large to upload directly. Because of this, I have uploded it to youtube and provided the link here:
